# Knapsack Approximation Suite

## Requirements

+ Python3

## Contents

### Scripts

  + test.py: script for testing algorithms against a generator
  + validate.py: script for validating an exact solver's correctness against problems with known solutions
  + analyze: contains scripts for extracting data from test runs

### Data

  + data: previous outputs from tests and analysis used in paper
    + n_sweep: sweeping problem size
    + mean_sweep: sweeping mean item size
    + dev_sweep: sweeping item size standard deviation
  + validation: set of 11 benchmark problems for demonstrating correctness of a solver

### Backend

  + problem.py: class file representing instance of knapsack problem
  + solver: module containing knapsack problem solvers
    + dynamic.py: contains exact solver
    + greedy.py: contains greedy approximation
  + generator: module containing knapsack problem generators
    + core.py: common functionality for generators
    + uniform.py: generator utilizing uniform distribution
    + gaussian.py: generator utilizing normal distribution
    + split.py: (experimental) generator for producing n items with a fixed net size
